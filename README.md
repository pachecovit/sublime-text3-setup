# Sublime Text 3 Setup - User Settings

Personal simple user settings to use on Sublime Text 3, feel free to change what you want.


## Afterglow Theme

I like the [Afterglow Theme](https://github.com/YabataDesign/afterglow-theme) with Monokai color scheme. All you'll need is restart Sublime Text after installation for the changes to take effect.


## Useful and awesome packages

All plugins are installed using Package Manager. `⌘`+`Shift`+`P` and type `install`. Then start typing the name of the extension you want to install.

### General 

### HTML, CSS & JS

### Git

### Markdown


## Settings - User

Accessible via: `SublimeText` &rarr; `Preferences` &rarr; `Settings – User`, or with `⌘`+`,'.'

```json

```


## Key Bindings - User

Accessible via: `SublimeText` &rarr; `Preferences` &rarr; `Key Bindings – User`. 

```

```


## Sublime from the Command Line

Sublime Text includes a command line tool which you just need to symlink up so that it's in your PATH file. In Sublime Text 3 simply copy this into a terminal session:

    ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl

Then you can open files in Sublime Text from the command line with:

    subl file.txt

Replacing `file.text` with the name of the file or folder you wish to open in Sublime Text.
